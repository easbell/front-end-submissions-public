 # Code Quality

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub (from either repository) that you are proud of
[handleFetch thunk](https://github.com/easbell/palette-picker-ui/blob/master/src/thunks/handleFetch.js)

 * Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
- We managed to make this thunk very dynamic so it serves many different purposes. 

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/easbell/palette-picker-ui/blob/master/src/components/Palette/Palette.js)

 * Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
- Lines 40: We would have like time to refactor the way colors were stored in state. Felt a bit hacky putting it together. Would like to refactor to have state just contain a colors key with an array of objects for each color.

 #### Link to Design Inspiration

 * Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it  
[design inspiration](https://dribbble.com/)    
- We utilized a very similar header with the same font. Also, our modal window was stylized after the window on dribble to save inspiration.

 #### Reflection on New Concepts

 * Describe your thoughts on server-side testing  
- Felt more simple than FE testing.
* Describe your thoughts on TravisCI  
- Having the deployment party was very helpful. We got everything up and running that day and switched our front end code to utilize the deployed backend.
* Describe your thoughts in creating a single project whose codebase was distributed across multiple repositories
- It was nice to have the separation of concerns. Having our project split allowed us to better track issues.
